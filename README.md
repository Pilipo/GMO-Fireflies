DotStar Fireflies
=================

Code for simple firefly emulation.

In the Arduino IDE:
 * Tools > Manage Libraries
 * Search "Adafruit DotStar"
 * Install
 * Compile
 * Upload Sketch

On the Uno-equivolent, wire pin 7 to the Data-In of the first dotstar and pin 8 to the Clock-In. Daisy-chain the subsequent pixels as needed and update the sketch variable "NUM_PIXELS" to the total number of dotstars in the sequence. Compile and upload as required.

More updates soon.
